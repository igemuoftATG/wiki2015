# Alberta Oil Stories 

Our research team operates at the University of Toronto on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee and Wendat people. In exploring the social and environmental connections of our project, particularly how our tool can be applied to bioremediation of Oil Sands tailings pond water in Alberta, we wanted to hear views directly from the most impacted people. The frontline communities dealing with issues of clean water accessibility in the area of Alberta's oil industry are largely indigenous communities who have experienced marginalization and injustice as a result of poor regulations. In August, our Policy and Practices team members went to Alberta to hear the stories of these communities.

##### Testamonials:  
"I had to move to Fort McMurray, Alberta to find a job, and I worked in the oil sands industry. I never liked it, my dad and grandparents would call me and tell me they had no clean water and fewer and fewer animals to hunt locally, and I knew it was a result of the industry I worked in. After a while, I was laid off due to budget cuts and I moved back to the Dene Tha' land in High Level, Alberta. It's been difficult trying to find a job here without the oil industry, but honestly I'm still happier not working for them. I know what they're doing to our land. For me, it would be great to be able to be employed by something that is solving these problems." 
-Clara, Dene Tha'   

Many First Nations are employed by the oil sands industry but not necessarily in support of the industry. As Chief Allan Adam of Fort Chipewyan has said, many of these indigenous workers are  "economic hostages" of this industry.   

"When I saw [the Toronto iGEM team], I saw a glimmer of hope for us."

### Further Research Collaboration
The leader of Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta also asked us to follow up with research regarding a synthetic biology invention to detect water toxins and show their presence in a cost-effective design so all families could test their own water. 

# University of Alberta Collaborations
On our first day in Alberta(August 25, 2015), we met professors at __University of Alberta__ who are currently doing research on land reclamation of __Oil Sands Tailings Ponds__.We were honoured to acquire his deep insight about the liquid tailings ponds. The adverse effects of tailings ponds how they have affected our land, air and water are well-known facts. The major issue we come across when talking about oil sands tailings pond is their density. Tailings water is thick dark liquid filled primarily with organic toxins. The thickness of the liquid makes it hard to use and reclaim as clean water.

Above picture shows __Dr. Thundat__ explaining his work with tailings water.

__Professor Thomas Thundat__ along with his research team has stepped ahead to engage modern technology into __land reclamation__ by using liquid densification techniques. He gave us important insight about our project along with it's potential application in industry with the use of our membrane bioreactor, which mostly deals with __water reclamation__.

Professor Thundat went out of his way to help us improve our membrane bioreactor design by allowing us to meet __Professor Mohtada Sadrzadeh__ who is currently working with micro/nano pore membranes and different filteration techniques along with desgning new membranes. He gave us important insight about the types of membranes and different filteration techniques (micro-filteration, ultra-filterstion, nano-filteration) that can work optimal for our bioreactor. We were honoured to visit __Dr. Thundat’s lab__ where __Mehrnaz Rahim__ briefed us about tailings water densification techniques. Later, we visited __Professor Sadrzadeh’s lab__ where __Behnam Khorshidi__  explained the effectiveness of different liquid filtration techniques in detail, through membranes with pore sizes smaller than a micron.

On our second day(August 26,2015) we met __Andrew Read__ at __Pembina Institute__. According to Read and the research of the __Pembina Institute__, the biggest challenges to projects focused on land or water reclamation from tailings ponds is the cost to the industry, and also the question of who will absorb that cost. As it stands, there is not enough money packed away in the security funds of the government or industry to fully finance remediation of all __77 square kilometres of wet tailings__, however that could change with both improved financial regulations and low-cost technologies like ours.

The part of the meeting that really resonated most with many of us was when Read mentioned that, _“previous government policies have not been effective”_. Major oil mining companies such as __Suncor__, __Syncrude Mildred Lake__, __Shell Muskeg River__ and __Shell Jackpine__ did not meet the _Directive 074–Alberta Energy Regulator_, which states the Tailings Performance and Requirements for Oil Sands Mining Schemes. Each oil company had its own set goal of Tailings Capture Requirements.  Not only were these companies unable to meet their requirements, even after negotiating lower standards with the regulatory bodies, but these same companies were also not penalized for not attaining this government regulation. It is understandable that operations costs are likely the biggest challenge for companies to not process more tailings pond to turn oil tailings from that yogurt consistency to a solid-brick, like we had learned from our visit to __Dr. Thundat’s lab__ at __University of Alberta__. However, the statistics that we were shown were from the 2011 to 2012 period, and according to __Read__, has not changed significantly. __Andrew Read__ was very helpful to our undergraduate team in explaining these challenges and respecting our desire to be apart of the solution to the oil tailings problem.

Water has been continually depleting in the rivers at an alarming rate to meet the requirements of water consumption in order to extract oil from sub earthen oil reserves. After being used in the process of extraction, this water mixed with toxic compounds is left in the form of a __thick dark liquid in tailings ponds__. No effective water reclamation techniques have been in effect so far, despite regulations from the government. Since, the oil industries have not played a crucial role in water and land reclamation, the responsibility falls onto the government to restore the water and land. When we talk about government being responsible for this job, we really are talking about money out of the pockets of taxpayers to clean up the mess that they had nothing to do with. If we take a moment to consider this, it seems likely that the oil extraction industry which was supposed to be building the economy will soon lead us under huge environmental stress, destroying nature, and any effort to restore this will have to be paid by people who didn’t choose this upon themseleves.

He acknowledged that technology like ours which is cheap and effective can not only reclaim the tailings water, but also lessen the stress of increasing depletion of water in Albertan rivers. However, as of now there has been considerably low amount of tailings water that has actually been reclaimed.
