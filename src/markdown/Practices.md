# iGEM Toronto Human Policy and Practices

The Human Policy and Practices team of Toronto iGEM has worked alongside the Wet Lab and Computational Biology teams to develop potential applications for our innovative project in synthetic biology. In addition, the team strives to focus on understanding the social, cultural, environmental and economic impacts of synthetic biology applications on various societal groups. Through community outreach in Toronto and Alberta, as well as research on the concept of vulnerable groups and the distribution of power within governments and industry, we were able to provide greater context for the legal and moral complexities of our project.

We decided to focus on the applications possible in the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canda. Specifically, our aim is to show a viable method of toxin degradation and bioremediation within the very toxic Oil Sands tailings ponds, using synthetic biology tools.   

## What are tailings ponds?
After the oil sands have been mined, oil is separated from the sand to be processed. Liquid “tailings” themselves are the leftover byproduct mixture of mostly sand, some water, clay and residual bitumen. Tailings ponds are large dam and dyke systems designed to contain and settle the water, sand, fine clays, silts, residual bitumen and other residual hydrocarbons of the extraction process including BTEX chemicals which are widely environmentally toxic.   

Our project focused on degradation of **toluene** specifically, though the applications could easily be applied to the other BTEX compounds and toxic substances in tailings ponds in the future.

## Indigenous Solidarity
Our research through the 2015 iGEM competition brought our team to a place of deep reflection on social issues facing communities in Canada and abroad. With help from Frontline Community Research Lead, Joanna Dowdell, the team became particularly aware of injustices seen against indigenous communities around the world in the past and present.  
Our team operates at the University of Toronto on the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee and Wendat people. It is important that we acknowledge we are people of the treaties, living on traditional indigenous lands. Our hope within the iGEM competition is to show solidarity with the Dene Tha' and Beaver Cree First Nations of Canada who have passionately recounted to our team the ways in which their rights to a healthy environment have thus-far been violated. Bringing awareness to this social and environmental issue is very important to our team, as is offering innovative solutions to some of the environmental strain faced by these communities.

The main purpose of our exploration in Athabasca was to understand and recount the stories of water management within the Oil Sands, and how such management affects the communities living downstream of industry and potential pollutants. The goal of our blog is to provide a platform to share the stories of environmental health and water-based interactions of those on the front lines of the Oil Sands industry – often these are First Nations communities, who are fighting for their right to a healthy environment through free, prior and informed consent of what developments are allowed on their lands.



From “Beautiful Destruction” Essay and Photography book by Louis Helbig.
The blog was updated throughout the week as we continue our journey through the stories of Alberta oil. Where we met proffessors at __University of Alberta__, __Keeper's of the water gathering__ three different first nations namely : __Dene Tha'__ , __Beaver Cree__ , __treaty 8__. We also visited suncor - one of the biggest oil companies in Canada - where we were briefed on the industrial process involved in the extraction of oil sands tailings water. 

Our team is working in bioengineering a version of non-harmful bacteria that could be added to tailings ponds, to breakdown toluene in the water to a safe alternative form. As one of the main harmful substances in tar sands tailings, toluene seemed an appropriate focus for our group in trying to aid public health for frontline communities affected by tar sands runoff.

There is a Policy and Practices aspect of our project, which aims to bridge our scientific work with the real world social issues of the tar sands tailings runoff.

We will be presenting our tailings ponds remediation research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in September, and we feel it would be truly inappropriate to do so without adequately advocating for the position of those most directly affected by the ponds. This is why we have ventured to Alberta, to listen to the stories and opinions of individuals and communities living around the oil industry.
