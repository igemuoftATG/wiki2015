## TodE and TodF Plasmid Design

Pseudomonas putida F1 species degrades toluene with the help of the tod operon. Toluene dioxygenase and toluene cis-dihydrodiol dehydroxygenase transcribed from todC1C2BA and todD genes, respectively, facilitate the breakdown of toluene to 3-methylcatechol. Gerben J. Zylstra et al. successfully constructed the plasmid pTDG602 containing todC1C2BAD genes. To achieve complete degradation of toluene down to carbon dioxide and water, we focused on designing a plasmid containing todE and todF genes. After cotransformation of DH10B cells with pTDG602 and our plasmid, E.Coli  should theoretically contain all the genes required to achieve complete degradation.

In order to achieve the best protein production efficiency, we codon optimized our todE and todF sequences. We used Salis RBS calculator to optimize translation efficiency, and a tunable promoter to determine optimum transcription for DH10B cells.

We also used BioBricks in the registry to design plasmids with different efficiencies by using RDP kit as shown below. In this process, we used promoter BBa_J23102 and RBS BBa_B0030.
